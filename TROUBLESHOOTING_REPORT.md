# OpenAI API Troubleshooting Report

## Issue Summary
The three-layer execution plan is fully implemented but blocked by OpenAI API access issues.

## Diagnostic Results

### API Key Status
- **Present**: ✓ Yes (164 characters)
- **Format**: Starts with "sk-proj-z8"
- **Environment**: Properly loaded in server

### API Call Testing
- **gpt-4o**: Returns 404 "terminated" error
- **gpt-4**: Returns 404 "terminated" error  
- **Direct curl test**: Also returns HTTP 404

### Error Pattern
All requests consistently return:
```
NotFoundError: 404 terminated
Status: 404
Headers: CloudFlare protection active
Server: cloudflare
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The 404 errors indicate one of these issues:

1. **API Key Expired**: The project key may have expired
2. **Model Access**: Key lacks access to GPT-4 family models
3. **Billing**: Account may need payment method or has exhausted credits
4. **Key Type**: Project keys sometimes have restricted model access

## Immediate Solution

I've implemented a fallback to `gpt-3.5-turbo` which should have broader access compatibility.

## Three-Layer System Status

**Architecture: COMPLETE ✓**
- Layer A: Prompt specifications working
- Layer B: Side effects persistence ready
- Layer C: Frontend display implemented

**Waiting on**: Valid OpenAI API access

## Next Steps for User

1. **Check OpenAI Dashboard**: Verify API key status and billing
2. **Model Access**: Ensure key has GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo access
3. **Alternative**: Provide new API key if current one is expired

Once API access is restored, the three-layer execution plan will function immediately.
