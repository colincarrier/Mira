Think of me as your personal research assistant who's always two steps ahead. Here's what makes Mira special:

üé§ VOICE-TO-INTELLIGENCE
Say: "Research the best Italian restaurants in San Francisco with outdoor seating"
‚Üí I'll transcribe, research actual restaurants, find reviews, get contact info, and create actionable todos

üì∏ VISUAL UNDERSTANDING  
Take a photo of a recipe, business card, or whiteboard
‚Üí I'll extract text, provide context, and organize everything intelligently

üß† SMART ORGANIZATION
Everything gets automatically sorted into 10 collections:
‚Ä¢ Personal, Work, Home, Family
‚Ä¢ Travel, Ideas, Movies & TV, Books
‚Ä¢ Health & Fitness, and Undefined (for edge cases)

üîç GOOGLE-STYLE RESEARCH
I don't just summarize - I research! Ask about:
‚Ä¢ "Best homeschooling curriculum for 8-year-olds"
‚Ä¢ "Compare Tesla Model 3 vs BMW i4"
‚Ä¢ "Plan a 5-day Tokyo itinerary"

And I'll find real data, compare options, provide ratings, and suggest next steps.

‚úÖ AUTO-TODO EXTRACTION
From any note, I automatically create actionable items:
"Research vacation rentals in Tuscany" becomes:
‚Üí "Compare Airbnb vs VRBO prices"
‚Üí "Check flight costs to Florence"
‚Üí "Read reviews for top 5 properties"

üí° TRY THIS NOW:
Voice record: "I want to start learning photography - recommend beginner cameras under $800"

Watch as I research actual camera models, compare specs, find current prices, and create a shopping checklist!
