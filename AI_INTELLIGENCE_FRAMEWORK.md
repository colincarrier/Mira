# Mira AI Intelligence Framework
## Deep Analysis & Contextual Understanding System

### Current State Analysis
The existing AI system provides basic content enhancement and task extraction but lacks the sophisticated intelligence needed for a truly valuable personal assistant. Current limitations:

1. **Limited Context Awareness**: Doesn't understand project complexity levels
2. **Binary Task Classification**: Simple todo extraction without understanding scope
3. **Surface-Level Analysis**: Summarizes rather than providing deep insights
4. **No Memory Integration**: Each input processed in isolation
5. **Fixed Response Structure**: Same output format regardless of input complexity

## Proposed Enhanced AI Intelligence System

### 1. Multi-Layer Intelligence Analysis

#### Context Classification Engine
The AI should first analyze input complexity and intent:

**Simple Tasks** (Single action, clear outcome)
- Examples: "Buy milk", "Call dentist", "Pay electric bill"
- Response: Clean logging with simple reminder format
- Todo Structure: Single actionable item with deadline inference

**Complex Projects** (Multi-step, research-heavy, evolving requirements)
- Examples: "Plan wedding", "Start a business", "Learn machine learning"
- Response: Project framework with phases, milestones, research areas
- Todo Structure: Hierarchical task breakdown with dependencies

**Research Inquiries** (Information gathering, decision support)
- Examples: "Best neighborhoods in Austin", "Compare investment options"
- Response: Comprehensive research with sources, pros/cons, next steps
- Todo Structure: Research tasks leading to decision points

**Personal Reflection** (Thoughts, ideas, experiences)
- Examples: "Had interesting conversation about AI ethics"
- Response: Knowledge capture with connection to related interests
- Todo Structure: Optional follow-up actions (read more, discuss with X)

### 2. Intelligent Task Architecture

#### Complexity-Aware Task Generation
Instead of flat todo lists, implement hierarchical task structures:

```
PROJECT: "Plan European vacation"
├── Research Phase (2-3 weeks)
│   ├── Define budget constraints
│   ├── Research destinations matching interests
│   └── Compare travel seasons/weather
├── Planning Phase (1-2 weeks)
│   ├── Book flights (dependent on destinations research)
│   ├── Reserve accommodations
│   └── Plan itinerary
└── Preparation Phase (1 week)
    ├── Handle travel documents
    ├── Pack appropriately
    └── Arrange local transportation
```

#### Smart Task Prioritization
- **Urgency Analysis**: Deadline inference from context
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understanding task prerequisites
- **Effort Estimation**: Time/complexity assessment
- **Impact Scoring**: Value/importance to user goals

### 3. Contextual Memory Integration

#### User Profile Learning
- **Interest Mapping**: Track domains of frequent inquiry
- **Skill Assessment**: Understand user's existing knowledge
- **Goal Patterns**: Identify recurring objectives
- **Decision History**: Learn from past choices and outcomes

#### Cross-Note Intelligence
- **Connection Discovery**: Link related notes across time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes/problems
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor project evolution
- **Knowledge Building**: Accumulate expertise in user's interest areas

### 4. Research Intelligence Engine

#### Deep Research Capabilities
- **Source Verification**: Use authoritative, current information
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Present balanced viewpoints
- **Actionable Intelligence**: Focus on what user can actually do
- **Local Context**: Consider user's location, regulations, culture

#### Dynamic Research Depth
- **Surface Scan**: Quick overview for simple questions
- **Medium Dive**: Comparative analysis for decisions
- **Deep Investigation**: Comprehensive research for complex projects

### 5. Predictive Assistance

#### Proactive Intelligence
- **Next Step Prediction**: Anticipate likely follow-up needs
- **Resource Preparation**: Pre-research related topics
- **Timing Optimization**: Suggest optimal scheduling
- **Risk Identification**: Flag potential obstacles early

#### Adaptive Suggestions
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Based on user history and current goals
- **Learning from Outcomes**: Improve suggestions based on what user actually does
- **Seasonal/Temporal Intelligence**: Consider time-relevant factors
