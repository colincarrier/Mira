# Mira AI Intelligence Framework

## Overview

Mira's AI Intelligence Framework represents a significant advancement in note processing and understanding. The system combines multiple AI models with a specialized "Mira AI Brain" that provides superhuman classification and intelligent processing of user inputs.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Mira AI Brain** (`server/utils/miraAIProcessing.ts`)
   - Advanced prompt engineering for intelligent classification
   - Disciplined creation of reminders, todos, and collections
   - Context-aware processing with time sensitivity analysis
   - Smart collection suggestions and UI layout hints

2. **Multi-Model Processing**
   - OpenAI GPT-4 for general AI analysis
   - Claude Sonnet for nuanced understanding
   - Mira Brain for specialized classification and organization

3. **Enhanced Processing Pipeline**
   - Real-time input classification
   - Intelligent todo extraction with quality filters
   - Time-sensitive reminder detection
   - Contextual collection organization

## Mira AI Brain Capabilities

### Input Classification

The Mira AI Brain classifies all inputs into three primary categories:

- **REMINDER**: Time-sensitive items requiring notification/recall
- **TODO**: Actionable tasks without specific time constraints  
- **COLLECTION**: Thematic groupings or reference materials

### Key Features

1. **Time Intelligence**
   - Automatic deadline detection
   - Smart notification scheduling
   - Context-aware timing recommendations

2. **Quality Control**
   - Judicious todo creation (avoids noise)
   - Meaningful action item extraction
   - Prevents over-fragmentation of tasks

3. **Smart Organization**
   - Intelligent collection suggestions
   - Pattern-based categorization
   - User preference learning

4. **Enhanced Output**
   - Rich context generation
   - UI layout recommendations
   - Priority and urgency assessment

## Processing Examples

### Example 1: Meeting Reminder
**Input**: "Meet with Sarah tomorrow at 3pm to discuss the project"
**Output**:
```json
{
  "type": "reminder",
  "title": "Meet with Sarah",
  "description": "Project discussion meeting scheduled for 3:00 PM",
  "notificationSchedule": ["same-day"],
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

### Example 2: Project Task
**Input**: "Research competitive analysis for the new product launch"
**Output**:
```json
{
  "type": "todo",
  "title": "Research competitive analysis",
  "description": "Comprehensive market research to inform product positioning and strategy",
  "followUps": ["Identify key competitors", "Analyze pricing strategies", "Document findings"],
  "priority": "high"
}
```

### Example 3: Reference Collection
**Input**: "Books I want to read: Atomic Habits, Deep Work, The Lean Startup"
**Output**:
```json
{
  "type": "collection",
  "title": "Books to Read",
  "description": "Personal reading list for professional development",
  "layoutHint": "list",
  "collectionSuggestion": {
    "name": "Books to Read",
    "icon": "ðŸ“š",
    "color": "blue"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details
