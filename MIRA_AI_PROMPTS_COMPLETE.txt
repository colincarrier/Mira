EDITING INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

To modify Mira's AI behavior:

2. **Modify Title Generation**: Update the "CRITICAL TITLE RULES" section 
3. **Adjust Content Structure**: Edit the V3 EVOLVE PATH prompt to change how content is organized
4. **Change Intent Detection**: Modify the intent classification logic in server/ai/v3/intent.ts
5. **Update Token Limits**: Adjust TOKEN_BUDGETS in shared/mira-response.ts to control processing depth

Remember: All prompts must return valid JSON. Changes to response structure require updates to the TypeScript interfaces in shared/mira-response.ts.
