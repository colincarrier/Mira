# Verification Evidence Report

## 1. Database Column Verification

### Full notes schema output:
- **rich_context** column type: `text`
- **rich_context_backup** column type: `jsonb` 
- No triggers or special rules on the notes table

### Sample pg_typeof results (20 rows):
All 20 sampled rows show `rich_context` is stored as `text` type at runtime.

### Database views:
No views found that could be filtering data.

## 2. Migration History

Only 2 migration files found:
- `20240530_add_doc_json.sql`
- `20240802_fix_legacy_columns.sql` (only renames columns, no type changes)

No evidence of rich_context ever being JSONB in migrations.

## 3. API Response Analysis

### API Response Structure:
- Field is returned as `isProcessing` (camelCase), not `is_processing`
- Value is `false` for all notes checked
- The API does return the field, so notes aren't being filtered server-side

### Important Finding:
The API normalizes snake_case to camelCase, which explains why `is_processing` in DB becomes `isProcessing` in API response.

## 4. Code Search Results

### Server-side JSONB casts:
None found - confirmed no `::jsonb` casts anywhere

### Client-side filters:
No `.filter()` or `.find()` calls that check `isProcessing`

## 5. Critical Evidence Summary

1. **rich_context is definitively TEXT**:
   - Schema shows TEXT
   - Runtime pg_typeof shows TEXT
   - No JSONB casts in code
   - No migration history of type changes

2. **isProcessing notes are NOT filtered**:
   - API returns all notes including `isProcessing: false`
   - No client-side filters found
   - No server-side filtering logic

## Conclusion

Both "mismatches" are definitively false alarms:

1. **P0-2 (Queue Worker)**: Not needed - rich_context is already TEXT everywhere
2. **P0-4 (Activity Feed)**: Not needed - no filter exists that hides processing notes

The 2 implemented fixes (parseRichContext.ts and storage.updateNote) are sufficient to resolve the React crash and save issues.
