To modernize “Mira” into a single monorepo that combines frontend PWA, backend API routes, AI workflows, IndexedDB/offline logic and Postgres/Drizzle into one coherent stack—and to make it easy to spin up on Replit (and later package as native iOS/Android)—I recommend migrating off “Vite + Express” into a Next.js project. Next.js gives you:

File-based routing for both pages and API endpoints (so you no longer need a custom Express server or wrestle with Vite’s catch-all).

Built-in PWA support (using next-pwa or manual service-worker injection), so your offline/IndexedDB logic lives alongside your pages.

Zero-config HMR and module bundling, eliminating MIME-type conflicts and custom middleware hacks.

A pathway to React Native (share your React/TypeScript components, business logic and AI wrappers between “web” and “mobile” with minimal friction).

Automatic code splitting and optimizations (Next.js will only serve exactly the JS/CSS modules you need at runtime).

Below is:

Part 1: A proposed “optimal architecture” (file/folder structure + tech stack choices + how modules fit together).

Part 2: A step-by-step migration guide—“instructions to give Replit” so that someone can spin up Mira as a Next.js app on Replit from scratch (or migrate the existing code).

Part 1. Optimal Architecture (monorepo with Next.js)
1.1. High-Level Stack
Framework: Next.js 13+ (using the App Router or Pages Router, whichever your team prefers—below we’ll assume the App Router for full flexibility).

Language: TypeScript everywhere.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (already in your code).

API: Next.js “API Routes” (app/api/… or pages/api/…) instead of a standalone Express server.

Database: PostgreSQL (in production) via Drizzle ORM.

Offline storage: IndexedDB (client-side) managed by a Zustand store.

AI backends:

OpenAI GPT-4o (wrapped in our own lib/ai/openai.ts)

Claude Sonnet 4 (wrapped in lib/ai/claude.ts)

PWA / service worker:

manifest.json + icons in /public

sw.js or next-pwa plugin to precache API responses and static assets

Shared code (e.g. shared/schema.ts, AI prompt definitions) in a /shared directory, importable from both pages and API routes.

Notes:

All formerly separate “client/…” components now live in app/components (or app/(screenName).tsx).

All “server/…” logic is refactored into the Next.js app/api/… folder, so that each file in app/api becomes an endpoint.

Shared TypeScript types/Drizzle schema remain in /shared so both your API code and your frontend code (for typing) can import them.

public/ holds your PWA manifest, icons, service worker (sw.js), and any other static images.

1.3. How Key Pieces Fit Together
Page rendering → Next.js will server-render your React components (or do client-side hydration). E.g. app/page.tsx is your “Home” screen. Any file under app/(routeName)/page.tsx is a route.

API routes →

app/api/ai/analyze.ts receives a POST with { content, mode }, calls lib/ai/openai.ts (which uses process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY) and returns a JSON AIAnalysisResult.

app/api/ai/deep.ts receives { content, userContext }, calls lib/ai/claude.ts, etc.

CRUD endpoints (notes/collections/todos) simply import drizzleClient from lib/db/drizzleClient.ts and run SQL as normal.

Database / Drizzle

In lib/db/drizzleClient.ts you do something like:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { createClient } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import postgres from "postgres";

const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
export const db = createClient(sql);

// Then you can do: db.select().from(...), db.insert(...) etc.
Migrations live under drizzle/migrations/, if you choose to track them.

Client-side state & offline

In store/appStore.ts you have your Zustand store that holds notes, todos, collections, etc.

In store/indexedDB.ts you open an IndexedDB database called MiraDB and create object stores for “notes,” “syncQueue,” etc., exactly as you had in the old client.

Whenever the user creates or edits a note, your front end writes it to IndexedDB first, then enqueues a “sync job” to POST to /api/sync (which itself writes to Postgres + Drizzle). On next app load or when connectivity returns, your sync code reconciles conflicts.

PWA / Service Worker

In public/manifest.json you have your name, icons, theme color, etc.

In public/sw.js you implement a fetch listener that:

Does a “network-first” strategy for /api/… requests (so that API calls get cached but can fall back if offline).

Does a “cache-first” strategy for static assets (/_next/static/…) so your app shell loads instantly on subsequent visits.

In next.config.js you can use next-pwa (or a custom pwa plugin) to automatically inject <link rel="manifest"> and register your service worker in _app.tsx (or layout.tsx).

AI wrappers

lib/ai/openai.ts exports analyzeWithOpenAI(content: string, mode: string): Promise<AIAnalysisResult>.

lib/ai/claude.ts exports analyzeWithClaude(content: string, userContext: any): Promise<AIAnalysisResult>.

Both modules live behind app/api/ai/*.ts so that your front end never touches the API keys—those live as Replit secrets (process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).

Authentication (ReplitAuth)

If you want to authenticate via Replit accounts, move server/replitAuth.ts into lib/auth/replitAuth.ts and then expose a Next.js app/api/auth.ts handler that runs the same logic.

The Next.js handler will either set a cookie or return a JWT for the front end to use.

Tailwind, TypeScript, linting

Copy your existing tailwind.config.js, tsconfig.json, and any ESLint config into the root.

Import your Tailwind base styles into app/globals.css, e.g.:

css
Copy
Edit
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Once you finish this re-architecture, your repository is basically “npm install & npm run dev” away from launching everything—pages, API, PWA, IndexedDB, Drizzle, AI calls—without any Vite catch-all collisions.

Part 2. Step-by-Step Migration Guide (for Replit)
Below are precise instructions to hand to someone (or to follow yourself) when setting up a brand-new Replit project to host Mira as a Next.js PWA, or to migrate your existing codebase. We assume Replit’s environment, where you can select a “Node.js” template, add environment variables, and define a .replit run command.

2.1. Create a New Replit (Next.js) or Import Existing
On Replit → click “Create” → choose “Import from GitHub” and paste your Mira repository URL, or click “Create Repl” → select “Node.js” → give it a name like mira-nextjs.

If you are just copying code manually, click “Node.js” → you’ll get an empty Node Repl.

We will turn that into a Next.js app by copying files in.

Populate the Repl

If you imported from GitHub, your folder structure is already present.

If you created a blank Node.js Repl, upload the new Next.js folder structure (the files under /mira) via Replit’s file upload or drag-and-drop.

Check that you now have (at minimum) files at the Replit root:

lua
Copy
Edit
.replit
next.config.js
package.json
tsconfig.json
tailwind.config.js
public/…
app/…
lib/…
shared/…
store/…
drizzle/…
If any of these are missing, copy them in from your local repo.

2.2. Configure package.json
Replace your existing package.json (or merge if you already had one) with something like:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "mira-nextjs",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p $PORT",            // Listen on Replit's assigned port
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start -p $PORT"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "13.x",                        // or latest stable
    "react": "18.x",
    "react-dom": "18.x",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.x",
    "drizzle-orm": "^1.x",                 // your version
    "postgres": "^3.x",                    // Postgres driver used by Drizzle
    "@drizzle-orm/postgres-js": "^x.x",    // Drizzle Postgres integration
    "@prisma/client": "if you need it",    // (optional) if you use Prisma-style
    "zustand": "^4.x",
    "idb": "^7.x",                         // for IndexedDB (if you use IDB)
    "swr": "^2.x",                         // or React Query if you prefer
    // AI SDKs
    "@anthropic-ai/sdk": "^x.x",
    "openai": "^4.x",
    "react-toastify": "^9.x",              // if you use toasts
    "react-query": "^4.x",                 // or @tanstack/react-query
    // Static assets (if any)
    "next-pwa": "^0.x"                     // if using next-pwa plugin
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.x",
    "eslint": "^8.x",
    "prettier": "^2.x",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.x",
    "postcss": "^8.x"
  }
}
Why “-p $PORT”?
Replit injects an environment variable PORT at runtime. Next.js by default binds to port 3000, but on Replit you must listen on process.env.PORT so your app is reachable.

After copying that in, run Shell → npm install (or click the ❑ “Run” button once, Replit will auto‐install).

2.3. Create/Reconcile next.config.js
If you want to use PWA, create next.config.js in the root with something like:

js
Copy
Edit
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const withPWA = require("next-pwa")({
  dest: "public",
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  images: {
    // If you’re pulling images from external sources, list domains here
    domains: ["cdn.openai.com", "anthropic.ai"],
  },
  env: {
    // Next.js will inline these into the bundle at build time, 
    // but note: do NOT put secrets here! Instead, rely on Replit’s Secrets.
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME: "Mira"
  }
});
If you prefer manual service worker registration instead of next-pwa, skip that package and simply place public/sw.js plus a small snippet in app/layout.tsx to register it.

2.4. Environment Variables (Replit “Secrets”)
In Replit‘s sidebar, click “🔒 Secrets” and add:

Key	Value	Remarks
OPENAI_API_KEY	<your OpenAI key>	used in lib/ai/openai.ts
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY	<your Claude Sonnet key>	used in lib/ai/claude.ts
DATABASE_URL	postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:PORT/DB	your Postgres connection string (can be Replit DB or external)
REPLIT_AUTH_SECRET	<some random string for cookies>	if you use ReplitAuth
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL	https://mira-yourusername.replit.app	for generating absolute URLs if needed

Note: In development (npm run dev), Next.js automatically injects process.env.PORT on Replit. No need to define a “PORT” secret.

2.5. Create .replit
At the root of your Repl, create a file named .replit with:

ini
Copy
Edit
# .replit
run = "npm run dev"
language = "nodejs"
That tells Replit: to “run” this project, do npm run dev, which (thanks to our package.json) executes:

perl
Copy
Edit
next dev -p $PORT
so Next.js listens on the correct port.

2.6. Copy/Migrate Code Into Next.js Structure
Assuming your existing repo has:

python-repl
Copy
Edit
client/
server/
shared/
...
Do the following:

Move all UI components from client/src/components/… → app/components/…

If you are using the App Router, put components you want available to multiple pages under app/components/.

If you still want a “pages” folder style (Pages Router), move them instead under components/… and create pages/… for each route.

Move client/src/pages/*.tsx → Next.js routes

E.g. client/src/pages/home.tsx → app/page.tsx

client/src/pages/settings.tsx → app/settings/page.tsx

client/src/pages/collection-detail.tsx → app/collections/[id]/page.tsx (and rename parameter accordingly).

Rename any file with capitals or dashes to Next’s conventions.

Bring client/src/lib/… into lib/utils.ts or lib/store/…

For instance, client/src/lib/queryClient.ts (if that wraps React Query) can go into app/lib/queryClient.ts.

client/src/lib/utils.ts can be lib/utils.ts.

Copy client/src/store/app-store.ts and client/src/store/indexeddb.ts → store/appStore.ts & store/indexedDB.ts

Confirm that "idb" or "idb-keyval" is installed so that your IndexedDB manager still works.

In your top-level _app.tsx or app/layout.tsx, wrap your app in the Zustand provider if needed.

Move any PWA files

client/public/manifest.json → public/manifest.json

client/public/sw.js → public/sw.js

client/public/*.svg icons → public/icons/…

Adjust <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"> in your app/layout.tsx so Next will include it in <head>.

Move server code → Next.js API routes
For each folder under server/…:

server/openai.ts → lib/ai/openai.ts

Wrap the same logic (initialize OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY })) and export a function like export async function analyzeNote(...) { … }.

server/anthropic.ts → lib/ai/claude.ts

Export export async function enhancedAnalysis(...) { … }.

server/db.ts → lib/db/drizzleClient.ts

ts
Copy
Edit
import { createClient } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import postgres from "postgres";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import { schema } from "../../shared/schema"; // adjust path

const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } });
export const db = drizzle(sql, { schema });
Now db can be imported in your API route files.

Routes

server/routes.ts presumably enumerates your Express routes.

For each route handler, create a matching file under app/api/….
Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
// server/routes.ts (example pseudocode)
// router.post("/api/notes", createNoteHandler);
// router.get("/api/notes/:id", getNoteHandler);
becomes:

ts
Copy
Edit
// app/api/notes/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { db } from "@/lib/db/drizzleClient";
import { notes } from "@/shared/schema";

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const body = await req.json();
  // validate, then insert into Drizzle:
  const newNote = await db.insert(notes).values({
    title: body.title,
    content: body.content,
    createdAt: new Date(),
    updatedAt: new Date(),
  }).returning();
  return NextResponse.json(newNote[0]);
}

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);
  const id = searchParams.get("id");
  const note = await db.select().from(notes).where(notes.id.eq(Number(id)));
  return NextResponse.json(note);
}
If you need PUT or DELETE, add export async function PUT(…) { … } or export async function DELETE(…) { … }.

Other server utilities

server/init-db.ts (creation of tables) → incorporate as a “migration script” in drizzle/migrations/ or call it manually in a Next.js build step (e.g. in package.json add "postinstall": "ts-node drizzle/init-db.ts", but usually you run migrations manually).

server/init-collections.ts (seed data) can run in a one-time script, or you can create an API route /api/seed to call it.

server/reprocess-notes.ts → create a Next.js-only script under scripts/reprocess-notes.ts, and run it via npm run reprocess-notes.

server/replitAuth.ts → incorporate into app/api/auth/route.ts to handle OAuth redirects or JWT logic.

server/welcome-note.ts, subscription-tiers.ts, onboarding-questions.ts → if they define static data or helper functions, move them under lib/….

Update imports

Anywhere you see paths like ../../server/openai → change to @/lib/ai/openai (depending on your tsconfig.json path aliases).

Next.js comes with a default tsconfig.json that uses "baseUrl": "." and "paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] }, so you can import modules as import { analyzeNote } from "@/lib/ai/openai";.

Configuring Drizzle schema

If shared/schema.ts already exports a Drizzle schema object, reference it from lib/db/drizzleClient.ts.

If not, define it as:

ts
Copy
Edit
// shared/schema.ts
import { pgTable, serial, text, timestamp, varchar } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const notes = pgTable("notes", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  title: varchar("title", { length: 255 }),
  content: text("content"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at").defaultNow(),
});

export const todos = pgTable("todos", {
  // …your fields…
});

export const collections = pgTable("collections", {
  // …your fields…
});
That way, all API route files can do import { notes, todos, collections } from "@/shared/schema";.

PWA Service Worker Registration

In your root layout (app/layout.tsx), add:

tsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("/sw.js")
      .then((reg) => console.log("SW registered", reg))
      .catch((err) => console.error("SW failed to register", err));
  }
}, []);
Confirm public/manifest.json has correct start_url: "/" and icons.

Tailwind Setup

In tailwind.config.js:

js
Copy
Edit
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", 
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
In app/globals.css:

css
Copy
Edit
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Make sure you import globals.css in app/layout.tsx:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import "@/globals.css";
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head />
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
Zustand + IndexedDB

In app/layout.tsx, wrap your entire app in the Zustand provider (if you use the <Provider> pattern).

Ensure store/indexedDB.ts runs initialize() on first load:

ts
Copy
Edit
// store/indexedDB.ts
import { openDB } from "idb";

export async function initializeIndexedDB() {
  const db = await openDB("MiraDB", 1, {
    upgrade(db) {
      const notesStore = db.createObjectStore("notes", { keyPath: "id" });
      notesStore.createIndex("collectionId", "collectionId");
      const syncStore = db.createObjectStore("syncQueue", { keyPath: "id", autoIncrement: true });
      syncStore.createIndex("timestamp", "timestamp");
    },
  });
  return db;
}
In the root (e.g. in a useEffect in app/page.tsx), call initializeIndexedDB() once so your store can begin pushing data locally.

Finalize Authentication

If you use Replit’s built-in OAuth, your flow will be:

User clicks “Login” → app/api/auth/login.ts redirects to Replit OAuth.

Replit calls your redirect URI (e.g. /api/auth/callback) → you grab a token, store a secure cookie, then redirect back to /.

On the front end, read that cookie/token and attach it to fetch requests so your API routes can verify the user.

Copy any helper utilities from server/replitAuth.ts into lib/auth/replitAuth.ts and have your app/api/auth/… handlers call them.

Test Locally (in Replit “Run”)

Click “Run” → Replit will execute npm run dev → next dev -p $PORT.

Visit the Replit URL (e.g. https://mira-yourusername.replit.app) → your Next.js app should load, offline fallback should be intact (try turning off network), and your API calls should respond.

Open Developer Tools → Network → confirm /sw.js is registered, /_next/static/… is served from cache on refresh.

2.7. Configuration Summary (for Replit)
.replit:

ini
Copy
Edit
run = "npm run dev"
language = "nodejs"
package.json:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p $PORT",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start -p $PORT"
  },
  "dependencies": { /* as above */ }
}
next.config.js (with next-pwa or manual SW registration).

tailwind.config.js and app/globals.css properly set.

Replit Secrets:

OPENAI_API_KEY

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

DATABASE_URL

REPLIT_AUTH_SECRET (if using ReplitAuth)

2.8. (Optional) Build & Launch for Production on Replit
In Replit’s “Shell” tab, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
Then, either rely on Replit to keep npm run dev running (development mode), or in production mode run

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
which executes next start -p $PORT.

Note: Replit automatically watches package.json and reruns npm install whenever you push new dependencies; it also auto-restarts your “run” command if files change.

2.9. Verifying Everything Works
Browse to https://<your-repl-url>

The PWA prompt (“Add Mira to Home Screen”) should appear if you open from a mobile device.

Offline mode: disable your network, reload; you should still see your last-cached UI because of the service worker + IndexedDB.

Test AI Endpoints

In DevTools → Network → filter by /api/ai/analyze.

Run a quick fetch("/api/ai/analyze", { method: "POST", headers: {"Content-Type":"application/json"}, body: JSON.stringify({ content: "Test note", mode: "analysis" }) }) from the console. It should return a JSON with complexityScore, todos, etc.

Test Drizzle/Database

Install a Postgres client (e.g. psql locally) or connect via a GUI to confirm your notes table is created.

Create a note via fetch("/api/notes", { method:"POST", body: JSON.stringify({ title: "Hello", content: "World" }) }). Then SELECT * FROM notes; → you should see that row.

Check Offline Sync

Create a note while online → confirm it writes to IndexedDB and syncs to the server.

Turn off your network (devtools offline) → create a second note → confirm it writes to IndexedDB but cannot immediately sync.

Reenable network → confirm your code picks up the “pending sync” queue and writes that second note to Postgres.

 Validate that your shared/schema.ts is imported by both front and API routes with correct TS path aliases

 Confirm service worker registration in app/layout.tsx and that public/manifest.json is correct for PWA

Once all of the above are in place, hitting “Run” on Replit will automatically:

Install dependencies (npm install).

Start Next.js in dev mode (next dev -p $PORT).

Serve your PWA on the Replit URL.

You now have:

A fully functional Next.js PWA (no more Vite catch-all problems).

API routes in the same codebase, backed by Drizzle/Postgres.

Offline-first behavior courtesy of IndexedDB + a service worker.

AI endpoints that securely use your environment variables.

An easy road to React Native (simply extract shared UI components + lib/ai logic into a new React Native app or Expo monorepo).

That completes the migration. At that point, you can:

Build and deploy to Vercel (just “npm run build && npm start”).

Or continue running on Replit for staging.

Feel free to share a link to your updated GitHub repo and test the Replit build. Once everything is green, you have fully migrated Mira from Vite + Express to a modern Next.js PWA architecture that will scale into 2026 and beyond.
