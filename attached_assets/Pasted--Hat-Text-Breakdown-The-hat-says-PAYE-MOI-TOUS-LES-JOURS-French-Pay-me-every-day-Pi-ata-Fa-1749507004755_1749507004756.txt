	•	Founders: Colin Carrier (ex-Twitch Chief Strategy Officer) and Josh Hossain

🔹 Key Features:
	•	Meme Engine: Lets users insert themselves into scenes from pop culture, music, politics, etc.
	•	AI Tools: Includes automatic face tracking, lip sync, voice generation, and motion matching.
	•	Remix Culture: Built around the idea that users build off each other’s content — a “TikTok for memes.”
	•	Social Layer: Memes are shareable like TikToks or Instagram Stories, designed for virality and low friction.

🔹 Cultural Impact:
	•	Popular with Gen Z and creator communities.
	•	Used in Discords, TikTok, and private group chats more than traditional public feeds.
	•	Seen as a subversive counterpoint to sanitized, high-effort social content — more spontaneous and irreverent.

🔹 AI Edge:
	•	The app blurs the line between user-generated content and AI remixing, offering a new layer of creativity that feels intuitive rather than technical.
	•	It’s an early example of “AI as a co-creator” in internet culture.
