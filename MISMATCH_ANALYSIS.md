# Mismatch Analysis: Patch vs Actual Code

## Mismatch 1: Queue Worker rich_context (P0-2)

### What the patch expects:
```diff
- rich_context = $2::jsonb,
+ rich_context = $2::text,
```

### What's actually in the code (queue-worker.ts lines 195-202):
```sql
await client.query(`
  UPDATE notes 
  SET 
    rich_context = $1,
    ai_enhanced = true,
    is_processing = false
  WHERE id = $2
`, [finalResponse, job.note_id]);
```

**Analysis**: The code doesn't have `::jsonb` cast. It's already storing as plain text/string without any type casting.

## Mismatch 2: Activity Feed Filter (P0-4)

### What the patch expects:
```diff
- const visibleNotes = notes.filter(n => !n.isProcessing);
+ const visibleNotes = notes; // show all, processing flag influences style only
```

### What's actually in the code (activity-feed.tsx lines 39-46):
```typescript
const filteredNotes = notes?.filter(note => {
  return note.content.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
}).sort((a, b) => {
  // Handle both created_at and createdAt field names
  const aDate = new Date(a.createdAt || a.created_at);
  const bDate = new Date(b.createdAt || b.created_at);
  return bDate.getTime() - aDate.getTime();
}) || [];
```

**Analysis**: The code only filters by search term, NOT by `isProcessing`. There's no filter removing processing notes.

## Additional Context from Patch Document

The patch document (Pasted--Based-on-your-repository...) states:

**P0-2**: "Column currently jsonb; code passes double-stringified value"
- But we see the column isn't cast as jsonb in the UPDATE query

**P0-4**: "visibleNotes = notes.filter(n => !n.isProcessing)"  
- But the actual variable is `filteredNotes` and it doesn't filter by isProcessing

## Possible Explanations:

1. **Different codebase version**: The patches might be for a different version/branch
2. **Already fixed**: These issues might have been fixed in a previous update
3. **Different files**: The problematic code might be in different files than expected
4. **Schema mismatch**: The database column type might be jsonb at the schema level, not in the query

## Recommendation:

1. Check the database schema to see if `rich_context` column is jsonb type
2. Search for other locations where notes might be filtered by `isProcessing`
3. Verify if these patches are for the current codebase version
