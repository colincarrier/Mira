- Add time-based filtering and sorting
- Create notification scheduling logic
- Build recurring reminder patterns

## AI Analysis Enhancement (Recently Completed)

### Completed Features:
- ✅ Restored sophisticated AI analysis with 17+ analysis fields
- ✅ Enhanced prompt template with comprehensive structure
- ✅ Identical prompts for OpenAI and Claude (like-for-like testing)

## UI/UX Improvements (Ongoing)

### Camera and Microphone Integration:
- ✅ Camera button (#a8bfa1 muted green)
- ✅ Mic button (#9bb8d3 soft blue)
- ✅ Subtle AI processing indicator (bouncing ball)

### Collections Organization:
- ✅ Collections order: To-dos (top-left), Personal (top-right), Home (bottom-left), Work (bottom-right)
- ✅ Individual line items display as todo-style clickable rows
- ❌ Collection super note pages still not working consistently (routing/loading issues)

## Database and Performance Optimizations

### Future Enhancements:
- **Indexing optimization** for time-based queries on reminders
- **Archive and cleanup systems** for old completed todos
- **Bulk operations** for managing large numbers of reminders
