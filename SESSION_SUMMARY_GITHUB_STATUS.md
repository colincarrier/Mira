# Session Summary - GitHub Push Status

## Current Git Status
```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Recent Commits (from git log)
- e504d51 (HEAD -> main) Improve app stability and fix content display issues across components
- f68e7c3 Restore note content and navigation on the note detail pages  
- 30a236e Improve display of individual notes and fix data loading issues

## Changes Made This Session
All code changes have been committed locally but **NOT pushed to GitHub** due to:

1. **Missing GITHUB_TOKEN**: Environment variable not available
2. **Git Lock Issues**: Persistent `.git/index.lock` file preventing operations
3. **Authentication Failures**: Token authentication not working with git push

## Files Modified & Committed Locally
1. **client/src/components/note-card.tsx** (8 LOC)
2. **client/src/components/activity-feed.tsx** (1 LOC)  
3. **client/src/components/NoteDetailSimple.tsx** (175 LOC - complete rewrite)
4. **EXACT_LOC_CHANGES_DETAILED.md** (new documentation file)
5. **DETAILED_CODE_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md** (new documentation file)

## Current Status
- ✅ All changes committed to local git repository
- ❌ Changes NOT pushed to GitHub remote repository
- ✅ Detailed documentation created for all code changes
- ❌ Core issue still unresolved: note content not displaying

## To Push to GitHub
User will need to manually:
1. Set up GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable OR
2. Use personal access token authentication OR  
3. Push via git commands with proper credentials

## Next Steps Needed
1. Push committed changes to GitHub
2. Investigate React rendering issue preventing note content display
3. Review and potentially revert unwanted UX changes (back button, title format)

## Repository State
Local repository contains all changes and is ready for push once authentication is resolved.
