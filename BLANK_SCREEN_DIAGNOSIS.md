# Blank Screen Diagnosis Report

## Root Cause Found

The blank screen issue is caused by a **CSS import order error** that's preventing the entire stylesheet from loading.

### Error Message in Console:
```
[vite:css] @import must precede all other statements (besides @charset or empty @layer)
2  |  @tailwind components;
3  |  @tailwind utilities;
4  |  @import './styles/tiptap.css';
```

### The Problem:
In `client/src/index.css`, the `@import './styles/tiptap.css'` statement appears AFTER the Tailwind directives. According to CSS spec, `@import` must come before any other statements except `@charset` or empty `@layer`.

### Current Structure (INCORRECT):
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@import './styles/tiptap.css';  // ❌ This is causing the error
```

### Should Be (CORRECT):
```css
@import './styles/tiptap.css';  // ✅ Import first
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Impact

1. **Complete CSS Failure**: When this error occurs, Vite fails to process the entire CSS file
2. **No Styles Applied**: The application renders with no styling, resulting in blank/broken layouts
3. **Component Visibility**: Elements may be present in DOM but invisible due to missing styles

## Additional Issues Found

1. **TypeScript Error in note-detail.tsx**: 
   - Line 1141-1163: Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'
   - This could cause render failures on the note detail page

2. **API Response**: The API endpoints are working correctly and returning data

## Fix Required

1. Move the `@import` statement to the top of `index.css`
2. Fix the TypeScript error in `note-detail.tsx` for the versionHistory mapping

This is a critical issue that needs immediate fixing as it affects the entire application's visual rendering.
