# COMPREHENSIVE MIRA ISSUES REPORT

## CLIENT-SIDE FALLBACK VIOLATIONS

### 1. REMOVED: Hardcoded Follow-up Questions
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
- Removed `getFollowUpQuestions()` function from note-card.tsx
- Replaced with AI-only `getAIFollowUpQuestions()` that reads from richContext
- No more client-side question generation

### 2. Missing Input Bar on Note Detail
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
- Added InputBar component to NoteDetailSimple.tsx
- Fixed bottom positioning with proper padding
- User can now input from note detail page

### 3. Image Processing Failure (Note 500)
**Analysis:** Note 500 shows:
- mediaUrl: "/uploads/7786b239-d32d-42da-95d3-931710e3d0cc.jpg" (uploaded)
- aiEnhanced: false (processing failed)
- richContext: null (no AI analysis)

## CURRENT AI PROCESSING STATUS

### OpenAI API Connection Issues
**Direct API Test:** ✅ Working (confirmed with curl)
**Intelligence V2 Router:** ✅ Connection test successful
**Application Processing:** ❌ Pipeline failing silently

### Root Cause Discovery & Fix
**Issue:** OpenAI returning conversational text instead of JSON
**Fix Applied:** 
- Modified prompt to be strict JSON processor
- Added `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` to OpenAI call
- Updated message structure for better JSON compliance
- Fixed image processing to use Intelligence V2 pipeline

## REMAINING CLIENT-SIDE FALLBACKS TO AUDIT

### Server-Side Fallback Systems
1. `server/utils/brain/promptTemplates/fallback.ts` - Generic fallback responses
2. `server/ai-taxonomy-engine.ts` - Hardcoded category insights  
3. `server/onboarding-questions.ts` - Static question templates

### Settings Modal
- Contains "Get AI-powered follow-up suggestions" toggle
- May be referencing removed client-side system

## CRITICAL PRIORITY FIXES

1. **Diagnose OpenAI API failure in application**
2. **Remove remaining fallback content systems**
3. **Fix image processing for uploaded media**
4. **Ensure all content comes from authentic AI processing**

## IMAGE PROCESSING INVESTIGATION NEEDED

Note 500 image upload succeeded but AI processing failed completely. Need to investigate:
- Image analysis pipeline
- Media processing workflow  
- Error handling in image mode
