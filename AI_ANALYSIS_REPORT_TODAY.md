---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS - UI RENDERING GAPS:

### 1. **Smart Actions Not Interactive**
- AI suggests "Add to Calendar: calendar", "Share: share", "Set Reminder: reminder"
- Currently displayed as plain text, should be clickable action buttons

### 2. **Next Steps Completely Hidden**
- Every note has actionable nextSteps in rich_context
- These provide immediate value but are not rendered in UI
- Examples: "Research feasibility", "Contact experts", "Confirm details"

### 3. **Rich Context Data Underutilized**
- recommendedActions with clickable links (Google Maps, etc.)
- researchResults with structured information
- quickInsights providing immediate context
- All stored in database but not displayed

### 4. **v2.0 vs Legacy Interface Inconsistency**
- Note #161 uses old interface (recommendedActions, researchResults)
- Others use v2.0 interface (entities, nextSteps, microQuestions)
- Need to standardize on v2.0 format

### 5. **Entity Recognition Not Displayed**
- All notes show empty entities arrays
- No visual indication of people, places, dates extracted

### 6. **Micro Questions Never Populated**
- Feature exists but returns empty arrays
- Could provide clarification prompts for ambiguous notes

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Add Smart Action Buttons:** Render aiSuggestion as interactive buttons
2. **Display Next Steps:** Show nextSteps as actionable checklist items
3. **Rich Context Panel:** Create expandable section for all rich_context data
4. **Entity Highlighting:** Visually highlight extracted entities in note content
5. **Complete v2.0 Migration:** Ensure all notes use consistent v2.0 interface structure
