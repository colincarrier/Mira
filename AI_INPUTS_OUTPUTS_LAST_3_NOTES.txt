==============================================================
SUMMARY: THREE-LAYER EXECUTION PLAN FAILURE ANALYSIS
==============================================================

## What Should Happen:
1. **Layer A:** Single prompt contract with guaranteed JSON schema
2. **Layer B:** Side effects persistence (todos, reminders, collections)
3. **Layer C:** Robust frontend display with fallbacks

## What Actually Happened:
1. **Layer A:** Prompt contract created but not being executed
2. **Layer B:** Side effects module created but never called
3. **Layer C:** Frontend updated but no AI data to display

## Root Cause:
The Intelligence-V2 Router is still routing through the OLD brain/miraAIProcessing.ts system instead of using the NEW prompt-specs.ts contract. The three-layer system was implemented but never connected to the actual processing pipeline.

## Evidence:
- All 3 notes completed processing but show isProcessing: false, aiEnhanced: false
- No AI analysis results saved to database
- No richContext generated using new prompt-specs.ts contract
- No todos created via new persist-side-effects system
- V2 Intelligence Router connected but not using new three-layer architecture

## Root Cause Identified:
The brain/miraAIProcessing.ts file routes to Intelligence-V2 but the V2 router is still using OLD recursive reasoning system instead of NEW prompt-specs.ts contract. The three-layer system was implemented as separate modules but never integrated into the actual processing pipeline.

## Technical Issue Found:
- Intelligence-V2 Router DOES use buildPrompt() from prompt-specs.ts correctly
- OpenAI API calls are being made but responses never reach database
- brain/miraAIProcessing.ts was expecting old recursive format instead of new three-layer format
- persistSideEffects() never called because routes.ts expects different format

## Latest Test Results:
- Note 488: "Test fixed three layer system" - isProcessing: true (still processing)
- Note 489: "Pick up groceries..." - isProcessing: true (still processing)
- Vector updates working but AI enhancement failing

## Current Status:
The three-layer prompt system is sending correct prompts to OpenAI but responses are not being processed correctly by the wrapper functions.
